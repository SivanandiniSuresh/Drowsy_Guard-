 Drowsy Guard

Drowsy Guard is a real-time driver drowsiness detection system built using **OpenCV** and computer vision techniques. The project is designed to enhance road safety by monitoring a driverâ€™s eye and head movements and providing alerts when signs of fatigue are detected.

Project Overview

Drowsy Guard leverages live video input from a camera to analyze facial features, blinking patterns, eye closure, and head movements. If early signs of drowsiness are identified, the system provides real-time alerts through visual, auditory, or haptic feedback to help prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

 Key Features

- Real-time video feed processing using OpenCV
- Detection of:
  - Eye closure
  - Blinking frequency
  - Head tilt and nodding
- Immediate alert system (visual, sound, or vibration)
- High accuracy and performance through extensive testing
- Suitable for both simulation and real-world driving environments


 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Dlib / Mediapipe (for facial landmark detection)
- NumPy
- Sound or alert library (e.g., `playsound`, `pyttsx3`)
